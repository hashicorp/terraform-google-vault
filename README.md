# Vault for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This repo contains a Terraform Module for how to deploy a [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) cluster on
[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Vault is an open source tool for managing
secrets. This Module uses [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) as a [storage backend](
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/index.html) and a [Consul](https://www.consul.io)
server cluster as a [high availability backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/ha.html):

![Vault architecture](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/blob/master/_docs/architecture.png?raw=true)

This Module includes the following submodules:

* [install-vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/install-valut): This module can be used to install Vault. It can be used in a
  [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) template to create a Vault
  [Google Image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images).

* [run-vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/run-vault): This module can be used to configure and run Vault. It can be used in a
  [Startup Script](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript)
  to fire up Vault while the server is booting.

* [vault-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster): Terraform code to deploy a cluster of Vault servers using a [Managed Instance
  Group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/).

* [vault-lb-fr](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-elb): Configures a [Regional External Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/)
  in front of Vault if you need to access it from the public Internet.

* [private-tls-cert](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/private-tls-cert): Generate a private TLS certificate for use with a private Vault
  cluster.

* [update-certificate-store](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/update-certificate-store): Add a trusted, CA public key to an OS's
  certificate store. This allows you to establish TLS connections to services that use this TLS certs signed by this
  CA without getting x509 certificate errors.




## What's a Terraform Module?

A Terraform Module refers to a self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. This repo
is a Terraform Module and contains many "submodules" which can be composed together to create useful infrastructure patterns.



## Who maintains this Module?

This Module is maintained by [Gruntwork](http://www.gruntwork.io/). If you're looking for help or commercial
support, send an email to [modules@gruntwork.io](mailto:modules@gruntwork.io?Subject=Vault%20Module).
Gruntwork can help with:

* Setup, customization, and support for this Terraform Module.
* Commercially supported Modules for other types of infrastructure, such as VPCs, Docker clusters, databases, and continuous integration.
* Modules that meet compliance requirements, such as HIPAA.
* Consulting & Training on AWS, Google Cloud, Terraform, and DevOps.



## How do you use this Module?

This Module adheres to [Terraform Module Conventions](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) and has the
following folder structure:

* [modules](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules): This folder contains the reusable code for this Terraform Module, broken down into one or more submodules.
* [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the submodules.
* [test](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and examples.

To deploy Vault with this Terraform Module, you will need to deploy two separate clusters: one to run
[Consul](https://www.consul.io/) servers (which Vault uses as a [high availability
backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/ha.html)) and one to run Vault servers.

To deploy the Consul server cluster, use the [Consul GCP Module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul).

To deploy the Vault cluster:

1. Create a Google Image that has Vault installed (using the [install-vault module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/install-vault)) and the Consul
   agent installed (using the [install-consul
   module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-consul)). Here is an
   [example Packer template](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-consul-image). Google Cloud does not allow the creation of public Images
   so you _must_ create this Image on your own to proceed!

1. Deploy that Image across a Managed Instance Group using the Terraform [vault-cluster-module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster).

1. Execute the [run-consul script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/run-consul)
   with the `--client` flag during boot on each Instance to have the Consul agent connect to the Consul server cluster.

1. Execute the [run-vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/run-vault) script during boot on each Instance to create the Vault cluster.

1. If you only need to access Vault from inside your GCP account (recommended), run the [install-dnsmasq
   module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-dnsmasq) on each server,
   and that server will be able to reach Vault using the Consul Server cluster as the DNS resolver (e.g. using an address
   like `vault.service.consul`). See the [vault-cluster-private example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-cluster-private) for working
   sample code.

1. If you need to access Vault from the public Internet, deploy the [vault-lb-fr module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-lb-fr) and have
   all requests to Vault go through the Load Balancer. See the [vault-cluster-public example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-cluster-public)
   for working sample code.

1. Head over to the [How do you use the Vault cluster?](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-vault/tree/master/modules/vault-cluster#how-do-you-use-the-vault-cluster) guide
   to learn how to initialize, unseal, and use Vault.

## How is this Module versioned?

This Terraform Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
